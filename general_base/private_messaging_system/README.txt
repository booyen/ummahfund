1. Make sure you have a database, if you do not you need to create one.

2. Edit the DB.php file with the information for your database.

3. Run the create_messages_table.sql file on your database.

4. Add pm_count to your users table as an int with a default value of 0, if you 
	do not have a users table or login system thing, you need to get one or make one.

5. If the table for your user information is not named users, you need to edit 
	the script pages, to the correct name of your user information table.

6. Make sure that during login, you make a sessioned variable named username, with 
	the user's username in the variable. If your sessioned username variable is 
	not named username, you need to edit the script pages to the correct session 
	variable for the username.

7. Upload the files and login.

8. Try to go to the inbox, if it works good, if it doesn't work e-mail me at bedfordd@egmods.com
